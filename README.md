Airport Traffic Control System 🚀

This project is a Python-based simulation of an Airport Traffic Control System that manages flight takeoffs and landings. It prioritizes flights based on urgency using Priority Queues and dynamically processes flight data from a CSV file.

Features
✅ Flight Scheduling – Manages takeoff and landing requests.
✅ Priority Queue Implementation – Handles emergency landings and priority-based scheduling.
✅ Runway Management – Ensures only one plane uses the runway at a time.
✅ CSV Data Input – Allows easy modification of flight schedules.

Technologies Used
Python 🐍
Queue & Priority Queue (queue module)
CSV File Handling (pandas module)

Future Enhancements
🔹 Multi-runway support
🔹 Real-time weather conditions affecting flights
🔹 Graphical interface for better visualization
